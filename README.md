# FriendFinder

Welcome to Friend finder! Friend finder is an online dating type simulator, but for friendship! This app uses a special theme of cartoon characters to figure out what cartoon character best matches your personality based on a sampling of 10 questions. The user answers these ten questions on a shifting scale of agreement with the question, where a 1 represents that they strongly disagree with what the question is asking and a 5 indicates that they strongly agree with what the question is asking.

The user must input their name and a link to their photo image. Then they must answer all ten of the questions. They way their score is calculated is by adding all the variables of their scores, (such that a 1 in every one of the ten questions would indicate an overall score of 10), and then compares the variable against the total score value of the ten characters. The characters were programmed, for testing and practicallity purposes, such that Jerry the Mouse sports all 1 values, while Goofy sports all 5 values and so forth. 

When the user has successfully submitted their survey and those scores have been tallied and then compared against all other of the set of 10 characters data, the closest match will be returned in a modal and congratulate the user for being similar to that cartoon character!

I hope you have fun playing with my friend finder!
